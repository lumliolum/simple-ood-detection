# INTRODUCTION

Implementation of paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03888.pdf.

Some ideas are also taken from here : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11297.pdf


The code structure, parameters are totally inspired (and lot of them copied) from here : https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification.

More info about the methods (used in training the classifier) are given in this blog : https://pytorch.org/blog/how-to-train-state-of-the-art-models-using-torchvision-latest-primitives/
